This repository contains all source data and required reference files to reproduce the analysis presented in the [poster](<Mandell CHOL YCC 2024 poster.pdf>).

To go through the analysis, clone the repository and install cancereffectsizeR as described on the [package website](https://townsend-lab-yale.github.io/cancereffectsizeR/index.html). Run through `cca_analysis.R` (the main analysis; bootstrapped signature extraction may take several hours, depending on your system). Then, to generate the signature stability figure, run through `signature_attribution_group_testing.R` and `signature_stability_dotplot.R`.

Full disclosure: The contents of the signature stability figure (Figure 3 on the poster) are slightly different from the original poster (also archived here) due to a tweak to how signature detection is calculated. No discussed results (or statistical significance) have changed, but the new figure reflects slightly different values and displays a signature (SBS16) that was not present in the original poster, as well as omitting an artifact signature (SBS50) that should have been filtered out.
